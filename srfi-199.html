<p>author's summary of reasons for withdrawal: As thoroughly discussed
  on the mailing list, a simple Scheme level API like the one proposed
  is unsatisfactory because a Scheme implementation can run arbitrary
  code that might set errno between any of 1) manually setting it, 2)
  a POSIX call possibly setting it, and 3) retrieving its value.
  This, along with EINTR loops (see the Worse is Better essay) need to
  be done at a low level, and no one has been able to come up with a
  suitable standard and universal high level API for any of this.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>The majority of P<small>OSIX</small> system and library calls
  require accessing <code>errno</code> to discern the specific cause
  of an error, and some require setting it to 0 before being called.
  This SRFI specifies procedures to both retrieve its value, and to
  set it.
</p>


<h2>Rationale</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/errno.html">P<small>OSIX</small> lvalue <code>errno</code></a> is
  implemented as "a macro or an identifier declared with external
  linkage".  It does not fit into the paradigm of

  many

  autogenerating FFIs such as Chibi Scheme's, and for the latter must
  be hand coded.  Its value is required when using SRFI 198
  <em>P<small>OSIX</small> system call exceptions</em>, which does not
  provide a procedure to get its value.  This SRFI will allow many
  implementers of P<small>OSIX</small> interfaces to focus on their
  particular system or library calls of interest without also
  providing these <code>errno</code> procedures or importing them
  from another more general library.
<p>


<h2>Specification</h2>

<dl>
<dt><code>(errno)</code> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rarr; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>exact integer</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(procedure)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns the current value of <code>errno</code>.
</p>
<table><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><pre class="example">(errno) &rArr; 2
</pre></td></tr></table>
</dd>
</dl>

<dl>
<dt> <code>(set-errno! <i>errno</i>)</code> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rarr; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>undefined</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(procedure)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Sets the current value of <code>errno</code>, where the argument <code><i>errno</i></code> is an exact integer.
</p>
<table><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><pre class="example">(errno) &rArr; 2
(set-errno! 0)
(errno) &rArr; 0
</pre></td></tr></table>
</dd>
</dl>


<h2>Implementation</h2>

<p>To be supplied for Chibi Scheme from its SRFI 170 sample implementation.</p>
