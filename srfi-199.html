<p>by Harold Ancell</p>

<h2>Status</h2>

??? the draft/final/withdrawn status of the SRFI, information on how
to subscribe to its mailing list, and important dates in its history.
The editor will add this section.

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>The majority of P<small>OSIX</small> system and library calls
  require accessing errno to discern the specific cause of an error,
  and some require setting it to 0 before calling them.  This SRFI
  specifies procedures to both retrieve its value, and to set it.
</p>

<h2>Issues</h2>

<p>None at present.</p>

<h2>Rationale</h2>

<p>Errno is a
  <a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/errno.html">P<small>OSIX</small> lvalue</a>,
  implemented as "a macro or an identifier declared with external
  linkage".  It does not fit into the paradigm of

  many??

  autogenerating FFIs such as Chibi Scheme's, and for the latter must
  be hand coded.  Its value is required to use SRFI 198,
  P<small>OSIX</small> system call exceptions, which does not provide
  a procedure to get its value.  This SRFI will allow many
  implementers of P<small>OSIX</small> interfaces to focus on their
  particular system or library calls of interest without also
  providing these errno procedures, or importing them from another
  more general library.
<p>

<h2>Specification</h2>

<div><code>(errno)</code> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rarr; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>integer</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(procedure)</div>
<p>Returns the current value of errno.</p>
<div><code>(set-errno! <i>errno</i>)</code> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rarr; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>undefined</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(procedure)</div>
<p>Sets the current value of errno.</p>

<h2>Implementation</h2>

<p>To be supplied for Chibi Scheme from its SRFI 170 sample implementation.</p>
